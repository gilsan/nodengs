"	"* MLPA is designed to detect deletions/duplications of one or more sequences in the DMD gene in a DNA sample. Deletions of a probe’s recognition sequence on the X-chromosome will lead to a complete absence of the corresponding probe amplification product in males, whereas female heterozygotes are recognizable by a 35-50% reduction in relative peak area. Note that a mutation or polymorphism in the sequence detected by a probe can also cause a reduction in relative peak area, even when not located exactly on the ligation site! In addition, some probe signals are more sensitive to sample purity and small changes in experimental conditions. Therefore, deletions and duplications detected by MLPA should always be confirmed by other methods. Not all deletions and duplications detected by MLPA will be pathogenic; users should always verify the latest scientific literature when interpreting their findings.

HS40 is the major regulatory element of the human alpha-globin locus and is located 40 kb upstream of the zeta-globin gene. Two HS40 specific probes are present. Deletions are known in which only the HS40 region was affected. One probe detects a sequence telomeric of HS40 and 5 probes detect sequences centromeric of HBQ1. These flanking probes are only included to delineate the extent of large HBA region copy number changes. Three probes (172, 214 and 220 nt) detect sequences that are present in both HBA1 and HBA2. The HBA1 and HBA2 genes are almost identical. Pairs of probes were designed for five locations with a very small sequence difference between the two genes: one probe detecting the HBA1 sequence and the other probe detecting the HBA2 sequence. Due to the close proximity of the genes, it is possible that in some healthy individuals the HBA2 sequence at one of these five locations is changed by gene conversion in the HBA1 sequence (or vice versa), without any clinical consequences.

395	MLPA	LPE369	VHL Gene MLPA Analysis Report	von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) (MIM #19330)	Genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes-adequate specimen	VHL on 3p25.3	*Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA)		"폰 히펠-린다우증후군은 중추 신경계 혈관모세포종, 망막 혈관모세포종, 신세포암, 췌장낭, 부신수질의 갈색세포종(pheochromocytoma), 부고환의 낭선종 및 내이의 내림프낭 종양등 여러 장기에 발생하는 악성 및 양성 종양을 특징으로 하는 질환으로 상염색체 우성 유전양상의 단일 유전자 질환입니다. 염색체 3p25에 위치한 종양 억제 유전자인 VHL 유전자가 알려진 유일한 원인 유전자이며 환자의 약 90-100%에서 VHL 유전자에 대한 분자유전학적검사로 돌연변이가 검출되는 것으로 알려져 있습니다. VHL 돌연변이의 11%를 차지하는 VHL 유전자의 large (partial or whole) deletion은 본 MLPA검사를 통해 확인할 수 있습니다."	"* MLPA is designed to detect deletions/duplications of one or more sequences in the VHL gene in a DNA sample.  Heterozygous deletions of probe recognition sequences should give a 35-50% reduced relative peak height of the amplification product of that probe. Note that a mutation or polymorphism in the sequence detected by a probe can also cause a reduction in relative peak area, even when not located exactly on the ligation site! In addition, some probe signals are more sensitive to sample purity and small changes in experimental conditions. Therefore, deletions and duplications detected by MLPA should always be confirmed by other methods. Not all deletions and duplications detected by MLPA will be pathogenic; users should always verify the latest scientific literature when interpreting their findings. Note that other defects such as small point mutations will not be detected by this MLPA test."

The TruSeq DNA Sample Preparation kit of Illumina was used to make the library. The Agilent SureSelect Target enrichment kit was used for in-solution enrichment of target regions. The enriched fragments were then amplified and sequenced on the HiSeq2000 system (illumina). After demultiplexing, the reads were aligned to the human reference genome hg19 (GRCh37) using BWA (0.7.12). Duplicate reads were removed with Picard MarkDuplicates (1.130), local realignment around indels was performed with GATK RealignerTargetCreator (3.4.0), base scores were recalibrated with GATK BaseRecalibrator (3.4.0), and then variants were called with GATK HaplotypeCaller (3.4.0). Variants were annotated using SnpEff (4.1g). 본 검사는 massively parallel sequencing 방법을 이용하여 연관된 유전자의 모든 coding exon과 인접 intron 부위를 분석하는 검사법입니다.  본 검사실은 2015 ACMG 지침의 분류에 따른  Pathogenic, Likely Pathogenic, Uncertain significance  변이에 대하여 Sanger sequencing으로 확인 후 보고하며 Likely benign, Benign 변이는 보고하지 않습니다(Genet Med. 2015 May;17(5):405-24.).
